# The Wikipedia Game Extension

So this is The Wikipedia Game but as a Google Chrome Extension.

I originally got this idea from a friend saying how they liked wikipedia things and with daily games types as a topic I had in mind, I thought of this.  
I know there's a website with the same thing, but now an extension to remind you/keep track. 

**Global Leaderboard Calendar [Future improvement]**
- Deploy and host a website with an interactable top 100 calendar


**Local leaderboard [Dynamic implementation]**
- Local Database
    - ID | Username | Date | Time spent | # of tries | Start link | End link
- Daily randomization
    - JSON string to send to global leaderboard server


**Cheat detection**
- No search bar [DONE]
- No side bar
- URL Stack tracing
